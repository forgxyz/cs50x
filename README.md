All my CS50x problem sets are in the submit50 repository so this is a copyover of that work from September and October 2019. Everything has been copied as submitted.  


### description
[link to course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2019/)  
Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches you how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. 68% of CS50 students have never taken CS before.
